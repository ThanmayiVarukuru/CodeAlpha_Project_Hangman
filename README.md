Hangman Game

Descrpition: This Hangman game is a simple word-guessing game where a random word is selected from a predefined list. Players try to guess the word by entering single letters. Correct guesses reveal the letter's position, while incorrect guesses reduce the 6 available attempts. The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts. Input validation ensures only valid, non-repeated letters are accepted. It provides feedback for each guess and displays the final outcome, including the correct word if the player loses.
